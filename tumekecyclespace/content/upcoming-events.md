# Upcoming Events

##### Drop-in weekly Sunday workshop

Our Sunday community workshop is open from 12-4pm, most weekends (not on public holidays – check our Facebook for updates).

We have tools and expertise to help with lots of things, but we can’t do everything. As part of coming to Tumeke, you get to do the repair yourself, learning more about how your bike works and giving you the skills and confidence to fix things on your own. 

We’re also happy to help with maintenance – checking chains, brakes, tyres and gears, cleaning, applying lubricant and so on. This can help prevent problems getting worse later.

See our FAQ page for more information about what we have available at the workshop.

##### Cycle Babes sesssions


Cycle Babes free-to-access sessions provide people with hands-on cycle skills, confidence and leadership abilities in a relaxed group setting. Skills covered can include puncture repair, tyre inflation, safety checks, riding confidence, route planning, cycle touring advice, and general tips and tricks. Cycle Babes warmly welcome women and gender diverse people of all ages and backgrounds to their informal and fun sessions.

Cycle Babes is all about learning from your peers, making new friends, recognising each other’s skills and sharing knowledge in a community group setting. So you can gain confidence in your abilities, learning by your own hand through the support of the group.

Follow Cycle Babes on Facebook or Eventbrite for updates about future sessions.
