# Bikes for Sale

We always have a wide range of styles and sizes of bikes for sale. All bikes we sell have been thoroughly safety checked to a comprehensive check list, lubed and serviced at Tumeke Cycle Space, and are ready to ride away.

You can also take a look at our range of bikes being made ready for sale, at our workshop.

Tumeke is open 12-4pm on Sundays. Come and see us for a test ride, or contact hello@tumekecyclespace.org.nz.
